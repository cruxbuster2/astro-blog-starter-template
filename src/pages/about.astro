		Hello! I’m Benjamin Chapin, a PhD candidate in Accounting at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). My research focuses on how artificial intelligence and feedback systems reshape managerial decision-making, emotional dynamics, and control environments in accounting practice. For example, I investigate how the source and tone of feedback — including from AI systems — affect creativity, effort, and emotions in accounting and managerial tasks.

		Professional & Academic Profile

		Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I gained experience in accounting practice and small-business performance measurement. That hands-on exposure sparked a natural curiosity to ask bigger questions: How does feedback work in organizations? What role does emotion play in decision-making? How will the growing use of algorithmic systems change the “control” piece of accounting and managerial systems?
		At VCU, I apply behavioral and experimental methods — tapping into psychology, management control systems, and human-machine interaction — to examine how evolving feedback and control regimes influence real-world outcomes. My teaching interests include managerial accounting, financial accounting, data analytics, and applying emerging technology in accounting education.

		Personal Life & Passions

		Outside of the classroom, I’m an outdoor-enthusiast at heart. Whether I’m scaling a cliff face, trimming a sail in breezy waters, or backpacking through remote wilderness, I love the challenge and clarity that nature brings. These hobbies keep me grounded and remind me of the value of perseverance, discovery, and stepping outside one’s comfort zone.
		At home, I’m lucky to share life with my wife, Jillian Chapin, whose creativity, adventurous spirit, and support are constant inspirations. Together, we enjoy exploring new places, seeking big views, and capturing the little moments in between.

		Why This Matters
		In a world where technology is rapidly changing how organizations operate, my goal is to bridge theory and practice — to ask not only what systems are doing, but how people feel and respond when systems change. By bringing together behavioral insights, experimental design, and real-world relevance, I aim to contribute to more transparent, effective, and human-sensitive control and feedback systems in business.

		Let’s Connect
		If you’re interested in chatting about behavioral accounting, making systems more human-centred, or simply talking trails and sails — I’d love to connect.
