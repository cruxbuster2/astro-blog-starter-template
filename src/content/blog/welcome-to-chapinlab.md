Welcome to ChapinLab! I'm excited to launch this space where I can share my research, thoughts on accounting and technology, and the occasional adventure story from life outside the office.

## Why This Site?

My name is Benjamin Chapin. I've accumulated plenty of ideas, projects, and experiences that don't always fit neatly into academic papers.

Rather than joining yet another social media platform, I decided to build something more permanent and personal. This site is that space.

## What You'll Find Here

**Research Updates**: I'll share progress on my working papers, insights from conferences, and thoughts on emerging trends in accounting research—particularly around AI, feedback systems, and behavioral dynamics.

**Technical Explorations**: From building this website (my first venture outside WordPress!) to data visualization experiments and automation projects, I'll document the technical side of research that often stays hidden.

**Life as a Doctoral Student**: The honest reality of navigating a PhD program—the challenges, victories, and lessons learned along the way.

**Adventures & Reflections**: Rock climbing, sailing, backpacking, and other pursuits that keep me sane and provide surprisingly relevant metaphors for research challenges.

## Current Research Focus

My dissertation work examines how AI-generated feedback affects managerial decision-making differently than human feedback. Specifically, I'm interested in:

- How feedback source (human vs. AI) influences creativity and effort in accounting tasks
- The role of emotional responses in mediating these effects
- Implications for management control system design in an AI-augmented workplace

I use experimental methods to tease apart these relationships, combining insights from accounting, psychology, and human-computer interaction.

## Why "ChapinLab"?

The name reflects how I approach research: as a laboratory for exploring ideas at the intersection of accounting, technology, and human behavior. It's experimental, iterative, and driven by curiosity about how systems really work—and how to make them work better.

## What's Next?

Over the coming weeks, I'll be adding:
- Detailed research summaries on my working papers
- Posts about setting up this Astro-based website on Cloudflare
- Reflections on navigating the job market as a behavioral accounting researcher
- Stories from recent climbing and sailing adventures

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow researchers, practitioners grappling with AI implementation challenges, or anyone curious about behavioral accounting. Feel free to explore the site and reach out if something resonates.

Thanks for visiting!
