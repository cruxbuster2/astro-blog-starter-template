				<h2>Teaching Motivation and Objectives</h2>
				<p>
					Classroom experiences have a lasting impact. I distinctly remember the excitement I felt in my 
					undergraduate accounting information systems class because the instructor aligned the coursework 
					with my career aspirations. That exciting feeling was a persistent influence on my 14 years as 
					an industry accountant and inspired many of my best professional achievements.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an instructor, I strive to create a memorable classroom experience with objectives informed 
					by research on motivation and feedback:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Foster domain-expertise</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Promote autonomy and efficacy</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Connect students meaningfully with the material</strong></li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
				
				<div class="course-card">
					<h3>Data Analytics for Accountants</h3>
					<p class="course-details">Virginia Commonwealth University | Two Sections</p>
					<p>
						Students use critical thinking with accounting information and analytical tools to make 
						data-driven decisions in complex business environments. The course emphasizes practical 
						application of modern analytics platforms.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong></p>
					<div class="tools-list">
						<span class="tool-tag">Excel</span>
						<span class="tool-tag">SQL</span>
						<span class="tool-tag">Power BI</span>
						<span class="tool-tag">Tableau</span>
						<span class="tool-tag">Alteryx</span>
						<span class="tool-tag">Knime</span>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: 1em;">
						My experience as a controller and CFO provides relevant industry insights. I use that 
						insight to give students opportunities to build confidence while applying knowledge, 
						facilitating connections between stakeholder objectives and data analytic frameworks 
						using accounting information.
					</p>

				<div class="course-card">
					<h3>Business Plan Financials for Construction Industry</h3>
					<p class="course-details">Virginia Tech, Myers-Lawson School of Construction | Guest Lecturer (2018)</p>
					<p>
						Led sessions on choosing business plan financials for securing investors in the construction 
						industry, bridging classroom theory with practical industry applications.

				<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
				
				<h3>Critical Thinking, Motivation, and Feedback</h3>
				<p>
					I foster an environment that encourages critical thinking for deeper understanding. I pose 
					questions frequently to guide students toward class objectives while promoting ownership of 
					the learning experience. Self-directed discussions help students develop connections with the 
					material, consistent with literature on autonomy and self-efficacy for intrinsic motivation.
				</p>
				
				<div class="student-quote">
					"I immediately reassure [others] that they are in good hands [referring to instructor] ... 
					especially the importance of learning how to critically think."
					<br><em>— Former Student</em>
				</div>

				<p>
					My research informs my feedback approach. I provide task-focused, self-referenced, and 
					constructive feedback, identifying specific next steps for improvement.
				</p>

				<h3>Teaching and Learning Augmented through Technology</h3>
				<p>
					I leverage my AI research to inform instruction and pedagogy. I co-authored "Suggestions for 
					the use of artificial intelligence tools in Ph.D. programs" and presented at the American 
					Accounting Association's Conference on Teaching and Learning Excellence.
				</p>
				<p>
					I view AI tools as extensions of traditional tools that meet practice demands while exciting 
					and inspiring students. Technology is both a design choice and a consequence of my teaching 
					approach.
				</p>

				<div class="student-quote">
					"Professor Chapin is the first professor I've had who truly shows that he cares about our 
					success in class and out of college. He would allow us to choose from different software 
					depending on our career requirements and would learn each one to grade assignments."
					<br><em>— Former Student</em>

				<h2>Teaching Interests</h2>

				<h2>Teaching Approach in Practice</h2>
				<div class="highlight-box">
					<p>
						My teaching experience has provided opportunities to apply my practical teaching goals of 
						motivation, feedback, and the use of technology to meet those ends. I design courses that:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Give students autonomy in tool selection based on their career goals</li>
						<li>Connect classroom learning to real industry scenarios from my 14 years in practice</li>
						<li>Provide frequent, constructive feedback that promotes growth and self-efficacy</li>
						<li>Incorporate cutting-edge technology while maintaining focus on fundamental concepts</li>
						<li>Encourage critical thinking through guided discussion and problem-solving</li>
