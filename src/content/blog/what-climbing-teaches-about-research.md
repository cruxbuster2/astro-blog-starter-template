Last weekend, I spent Saturday morning working on a challenging boulder problem at my local climbing gym. After dozens of attempts over several weeks, I finally sent it. Sunday morning, I sat down to revise a section of my dissertation that had been frustrating me for months. The breakthrough came easier than expected.

Coincidence? Maybe. But the more time I spend both climbing and doing research, the more parallels I notice.

## Problem-Solving as Puzzle-Solving

**In climbing**: You're looking at a sequence of holds leading to the top. The route is defined, but *how* you climb it—the exact body positions, weight distribution, and movement sequences—is yours to figure out.

**In research**: You have a research question and some data or a proposed experiment. The boundaries are set, but the path to insight requires creativity, iteration, and often approaching the problem from unexpected angles.

Both require:
- Breaking big challenges into smaller, manageable sections
- Trying multiple approaches when the obvious one doesn't work
- Recognizing patterns from previous experience
- Knowing when to rest and come back with fresh perspective

## The Importance of Beta (and Literature Reviews)

In climbing, "beta" is insider information about how to climb a route—which holds to use, where to place your feet, what sequence works best. Experienced climbers share beta to help others succeed.

In research, we have literature reviews. Reading what others have discovered is like getting beta for your research problem: Here's what worked, here's what didn't, here's the tricky section everyone struggles with.

**The catch**: Just because beta exists doesn't mean you can immediately execute it. You still need to develop your own technique, build the necessary strength, and adapt the solution to your style.

Similarly, reading that someone else ran a particular experimental design doesn't mean you can simply replicate it. You need to understand *why* those methods worked, build your own expertise, and adapt the approach to your specific context.

## Fear and the Comfort Zone

**In climbing**: There's a moment on every challenging route where you have to commit to a move that feels scary. Maybe it's a dynamic reach to a distant hold, or trusting a small foothold with your full weight. Hesitation burns energy; commitment gives you the best chance of success.

**In research**: There's a similar moment when you have to commit to a research design, submit a paper for review, or present findings that might be challenged. The fear of being wrong is real. But progress requires moving beyond that fear.

The paradox: The more you practice moving through fear in one domain (climbing), the more that skill transfers to others (research, teaching, public speaking).

## Failure as Feedback

Falling is fundamental to climbing. You try a route, fall off, learn something, try again. The rock doesn't judge; it simply provides honest feedback about whether your technique worked.

Academic research *should* work this way, but often feels higher stakes:
- Rejected papers feel personal
- Null results feel like failures rather than findings
- Critical reviews can sting

But the best researchers, like the best climbers, reframe failure as data:
- This approach didn't work; what does that tell me?
- This reviewer raised a concern; how does that improve my thinking?
- This result wasn't what I expected; what am I learning?

## Rest Days and Sustainable Progress

Experienced climbers know that progress happens during rest, not just during training. Muscles need recovery time to build strength. Mental energy needs replenishment.

Research is no different, yet PhD programs often glorify constant grinding. The reality:
- Your best insights often come during walks, not at the desk
- Burnout helps no one
- Diverse experiences (like outdoor adventures) provide cognitive breaks that enhance creativity

I've solved more research problems while hiking, sailing, or climbing than during marathon desk sessions. The subconscious mind works on problems when you give it space.

## The Long View

**In climbing**: You don't go from beginner to expert overnight. You build gradually—finger strength, technique, mental game. Some people progress faster, but everyone follows their own timeline. Comparing yourself to others misses the point.

**In PhD programs**: Some peers publish faster, present at more conferences, or seem to have everything figured out. But research careers are long. What matters is building strong foundations, developing genuine expertise, and finding sustainable rhythms.

A challenging PhD dissertation is like a multi-pitch climbing route—you can't see the top from the ground, and you tackle it one pitch at a time. Focus on the immediate section, trust your preparation, and keep moving upward.

## Bringing It Full Circle

My advisor wanted me to showcase "all the strange things" I do. At first, these pursuits felt disconnected from academic identity: serious researchers do research, right?

But the truth is that diverse experiences make for better researchers:
- Physical challenges build mental resilience
- Outdoor problem-solving sharpens analytical thinking  
- Managing fear in one domain translates to others
- Understanding your own behavioral responses to challenges makes you better at studying others' behavior

So yes, I'm an accounting researcher who studies AI and behavioral dynamics. I'm also a climber, sailor, and outdoor enthusiast. These identities aren't separate—they're complementary.

## Your Turn

What activities outside your professional work inform how you approach problems? I'd bet there are more connections than you realize.

Next time you're stuck on a work challenge, consider: What would happen if you approached it like [insert your favorite activity]? The perspective shift might be exactly what you need.
